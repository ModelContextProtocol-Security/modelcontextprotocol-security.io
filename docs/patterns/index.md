# Reference Patterns

Architecture patterns and deployment guides for common MCP security scenarios. These patterns provide proven approaches to secure MCP deployments.

## Available Patterns

### Development Patterns
- **[Local Dev Container](local-dev-container.md)** - Secure development environment setup for MCP server development

### Production Patterns
- **[LLM Heaven VPS](llm-heaven-vps.md)** - Isolated cloud deployment pattern for production MCP servers
- **[Enterprise Gateway](enterprise-gateway.md)** - Corporate-grade MCP security architecture for enterprise deployments

## Pattern Categories

### By Environment
- **Development** - Secure local development setups
- **Staging** - Pre-production security testing
- **Production** - Enterprise-grade deployment patterns

### By Scale
- **Individual** - Single developer or small team patterns
- **Team** - Multi-developer collaborative patterns
- **Enterprise** - Large-scale organizational patterns

### By Security Level
- **Standard** - Basic security implementations
- **Enhanced** - Advanced security controls
- **Maximum** - Highest security implementations

## Using These Patterns

1. **Select Pattern** - Choose the pattern that matches your environment and requirements
2. **Customize** - Adapt the pattern to your specific needs
3. **Implement** - Deploy following the pattern guidelines
4. **Monitor** - Set up monitoring as recommended in the pattern
5. **Iterate** - Improve based on operational experience

## Contributing Patterns

We welcome contributions of new patterns and improvements to existing ones:

### Pattern Contributions
- **Document Architecture** - Provide detailed architecture diagrams and explanations
- **Share Configurations** - Include working configuration files and scripts
- **Provide Examples** - Show real-world implementations
