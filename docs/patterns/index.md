# Reference Patterns

This section provides battle-tested architectures and deployment patterns for securing Model Context Protocol implementations. Each pattern includes infrastructure diagrams, configuration examples, security considerations, and real-world implementation guidance developed by the community.

## Community Discussion

**[Architecture Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share your deployment patterns, discuss architecture challenges, and collaborate with other practitioners on secure MCP implementations.

## Available Patterns

### [Local Development Container](local-dev-container.md)
**Use Case:** Secure containerized development environment for MCP testing and development  
**Security Level:** Basic isolation with development-friendly access  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Best For:** Individual developers and small teams

### [LLM Heaven VPS](llm-heaven-vps.md)
**Use Case:** Isolated virtual private server pattern for production MCP deployments  
**Security Level:** Strong isolation with controlled access  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Best For:** Small to medium production deployments

### [Enterprise Gateway](enterprise-gateway.md)
**Use Case:** Centralized API gateway pattern with policy enforcement and comprehensive observability  
**Security Level:** Enterprise-grade with full compliance capabilities  
**Complexity:** High  
**Best For:** Large organizations with strict security requirements

## Pattern Selection Guide

### Choose the Right Pattern

**For Development & Testing:**
- **Local Container** - Safe local development with minimal setup
