# LLM Heaven VPS Pattern

This pattern implements an isolated cloud-based development and execution environment for MCP servers using dedicated virtual private servers (VPS) with comprehensive security controls and monitoring.

## Overview

The LLM Heaven VPS pattern provides maximum isolation by running MCP servers in dedicated cloud instances that can be easily created, monitored, and destroyed. This approach is ideal for high-risk workloads or when complete isolation from other systems is required.

## Architecture

This section will detail:
- VPS provisioning and configuration automation
- Network security and access controls
- Multi-tenancy and resource isolation
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Implementation

Comprehensive implementation guidance will include:
- Cloud provider selection and setup
- Infrastructure-as-code templates
- Security hardening procedures
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Cost optimization strategies

## Use Cases

Perfect for production workloads, high-security environments, multi-tenant scenarios, and organizations that require complete isolation between different MCP deployments.
