# Enterprise Gateway Pattern

This pattern implements a corporate-grade MCP security architecture using service mesh technologies, API gateways, and enterprise security controls to provide comprehensive protection for large-scale MCP deployments.

## Overview

The enterprise gateway pattern is designed for organizations that need to deploy MCP servers at scale with comprehensive security, compliance, and operational controls. This pattern integrates with existing enterprise security infrastructure and provides centralized management and monitoring.

## Architecture

This section will cover:
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)
- API gateway configuration and policies
- Identity and access management integration
- Network security and microsegmentation
- Centralized logging and monitoring

## Implementation

Detailed implementation guidance will include:
- Kubernetes cluster setup and hardening
- Service mesh configuration and policies
- API gateway deployment and configuration
- Integration with enterprise identity providers
- Compliance and audit logging setup

## Use Cases

Essential for large enterprises, regulated industries, multi-team environments, and organizations with complex compliance requirements that need centralized security controls and oversight.
