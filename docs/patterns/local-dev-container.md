# Local Development Container Pattern

This pattern establishes a secure development environment for MCP servers using Docker containers with proper security controls, enabling developers to build and test MCP integrations safely on their local machines.

## Overview

The local development container pattern provides isolation and security for MCP development work while maintaining productivity and ease of use. This approach prevents potentially unsafe MCP servers from accessing the developer's host system directly.

## Architecture

This section will include:
- Docker container security configuration
- Volume mounting strategies for code and data
- Network isolation setup
- Development workflow integration
- Security monitoring and logging

## Implementation

Detailed implementation guidance will cover:
- Docker security best practices
- Container image hardening
- Development environment setup scripts
- Integration with popular IDEs and editors
- Testing and validation procedures

## Use Cases

Ideal for individual developers, small teams, and organizations that need to develop custom MCP servers while maintaining security boundaries.
