# Audit an MCP Server

This section provides comprehensive guidance on how to audit Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for security vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and best practice compliance. Learn how to evaluate MCP implementations and contribute to our community knowledge base.

## Community Discussion

**[Join the Audit Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share your audit experiences, ask questions, and collaborate with other security professionals on MCP auditing techniques.

## Community Audit Database

**[ModelContextProtocol-Security/audit-db](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/audit-db)** - Our community-maintained database of MCP server security audit results, including:

- Security assessment reports for popular MCP servers
- Automated scan results and security scorecards
- Best practice compliance ratings
- Community-contributed audit findings
- Remediation tracking and fix verification

## Audit Resources

### [Selection Scorecard](scorecard.md)
Interactive evaluation criteria to help you choose secure MCP servers based on maintenance activity, security practices, and community trust indicators.

### [Step-by-Step Audit Guide](step-by-step-guide.md)
Comprehensive manual audit process covering code review, configuration analysis, and security testing methodologies.

### [MCP Inspector Tool](mcp-inspector.md)
Automated security scanning tool for MCP servers (Coming Soon) - will integrate with our audit database for streamlined vulnerability detection.

## Why Audit MCP Servers?

MCP servers act as critical bridges between AI agents and external systems, making them high-value targets for attackers. Regular security audits help identify:

- **Supply chain risks** - Compromised or abandoned repositories
- **Code quality issues** - Insecure coding practices and vulnerabilities
- **Configuration weaknesses** - Overprivileged access and exposed credentials
- **Runtime security gaps** - Inadequate isolation and monitoring
