# MCP Inspector - Automated Security Scanning

**Status: Coming Soon (Q4 2025)**

MCP Inspector is an automated security scanning tool designed to streamline the auditing process for Model Context Protocol servers. It will integrate directly with our community audit database to provide real-time security assessments and vulnerability detection.

## Planned Features

### Automated Code Analysis
- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive code security scanning using multiple engines
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Configuration Review**: Security configuration assessment and hardening recommendations
- **Supply Chain Analysis**: Repository integrity and maintainer verification

### Runtime Security Testing
- **Container Analysis**: Docker image security scanning and configuration review
- **Network Testing**: API endpoint security testing and traffic analysis
- **Privilege Analysis**: Permission and access control verification
- **Resource Monitoring**: Runtime behavior analysis and anomaly detection

### Integration with Audit Database
- **Automated Reporting**: Direct submission of scan results to the audit database
- **Historical Tracking**: Trend analysis and security posture monitoring
- **Community Sharing**: Anonymized security metrics and threat intelligence
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Scheduled rescans and alert notifications

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Scanner Engine**: Multi-language static analysis and security testing
- **Database Connector**: Seamless integration with audit and vulnerability databases
- **Reporting Framework**: Standardized security report generation
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API for programmatic access and CI/CD integration

### Deployment Options
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for local and CI/CD environments
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based scanning and report visualization
- **GitHub Action**: Automated scanning for pull requests and releases
- **Docker Container**: Containerized deployment for isolated scanning
