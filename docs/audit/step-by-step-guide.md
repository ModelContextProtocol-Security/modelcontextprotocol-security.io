# Step-by-Step MCP Audit Guide

This comprehensive guide walks you through the process of manually auditing Model Context Protocol servers for security vulnerabilities and compliance with best practices. Use this guide to perform thorough security assessments and contribute findings to our community audit database.

## Before You Begin

1. **Check the Audit Database**: Visit [audit-db](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/audit-db) to see if the MCP server has already been audited
2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary tools and a secure testing environment
3. **Document Your Process**: Use our audit report template for consistent documentation

## Phase 1: Repository Assessment

### 1.1 Provenance Verification
- [ ] Verify repository authenticity and ownership
- [ ] Check for verified commits and signed tags
- [ ] Review contributor history and maintainer reputation
- [ ] Assess project governance and decision-making processes

### 1.2 Code Quality Analysis
- [ ] Review repository structure and organization
- [ ] Check for comprehensive README and documentation
- [ ] Verify presence of security-related files (SECURITY.md, etc.)
- [ ] Assess test coverage and continuous integration setup

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Identify all dependencies and their versions
- [ ] Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Review dependency update policies and practices
- [ ] Assess supply chain security measures

## Phase 2: Code Security Review

### 2.1 Input Validation
- [ ] Review all input handling and sanitization
- [ ] Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, etc.)
- [ ] Verify proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Test boundary conditions and edge cases

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Review credential handling and storage
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Verify access control implementations
- [ ] Assess privilege escalation risks

### 2.3 Data Protection
- [ ] Review data encryption in transit and at rest
- [ ] Check for sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Verify secure configuration management
- [ ] Assess data retention and deletion policies

## Phase 3: Runtime Security Testing

### 3.1 Container Security
- [ ] Review Dockerfile and container configuration
- [ ] Check for privilege escalation in containers
- [ ] Verify resource limits and isolation
- [ ] Test container escape scenarios

### 3.2 Network Security
- [ ] Review network communication patterns
- [ ] Check for unencrypted communications
- [ ] Verify firewall and access control rules
- [ ] Test for information disclosure

### 3.3 Operational Security
- [ ] Review logging and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Check for security event detection
- [ ] Verify incident response procedures
- [ ] Test backup and recovery processes

## Phase 4: Documentation & Reporting

### 4.1 Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] Classify findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Provide proof-of-concept for identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document remediation recommendations
- [ ] Assess business impact and risk

### 4.2 Compliance Review
- [ ] Check adherence to security best practices
- [ ] Review compliance with relevant standards
- [ ] Verify implementation of security controls
- [ ] Document gaps and improvement opportunities

## Reporting Your Findings

### Contributing to the Audit Database
1. **Use the Template**: Follow our standardized audit report template
2. **Include Evidence**: Provide screenshots, code snippets, and test results
3. **Classify Severity**: Use our severity classification system
4. **Submit via PR**: Create a pull request to the audit database repository
5. **Participate in Review**: Engage with community feedback and validation

### Coordinated Disclosure
For critical vulnerabilities:
1. **Contact Maintainers**: Report privately to project maintainers first
2. **Allow Response Time**: Give reasonable time for patches (typically 90 days)
3. **Coordinate with CSA**: Work with our security team for proper disclosure
4. **Update Database**: Add findings to audit database after public disclosure

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Static Analysis**: Semgrep, CodeQL, ESLint Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check
- **Container Scanning**: Docker Scout, Trivy, Clair
- **Runtime Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, custom scripts
