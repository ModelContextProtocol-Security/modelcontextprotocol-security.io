## How to Report Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability in an MCP server or related infrastructure:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue or discussion
2. **Contact our security team** at: wg-mcp-security@cloudsecurityalliance.org
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Affected MCP server and version
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation if known
4. **Allow reasonable time** for coordinated disclosure (typically 90 days)
5. **Work with us** on public disclosure timing and content

### Public Discussion Guidelines

Once a vulnerability is publicly disclosed:
- **Share your analysis** in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)
- **Contribute to the knowledge base** by adding detailed information to our vulnerability database
- **Help others understand** the implications and remediation steps
- **Develop tools** for detection and mitigation

## Advisory Process

Our security advisory process follows industry best practices and emphasizes community involvement:

### Triage & Assessment
- **Community Review** - Security researchers help evaluate and classify findings
- **Severity Scoring** - Collaborative assessment using CVSS v3.1
- **Impact Analysis** - Understanding real-world implications for MCP deployments

### Coordination & Disclosure
- **Vendor Engagement** - Working with MCP server maintainers on fixes
- **Timeline Management** - Balancing responsible disclosure with community protection
- **Public Communication** - Clear, actionable guidance for the community

### Post-Disclosure Support
- **Ongoing Discussion** - Community forums for questions and implementation guidance
- **Tool Development** - Creating detection and mitigation utilities
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Documenting lessons learned for future reference

## Severity Classification

We use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 to rate vulnerabilities:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)** - Immediate action required, widespread impact
- **High (7.0-8.9)** - Urgent remediation needed, significant risk
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)** - Important security update, moderate risk
- **Low (0.1-3.9)** - Minor security improvement, limited impact

## Community Resources

### Research Collaboration
- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share research findings and collaborate
- **Working Group Meetings** - Participate in security research discussions
- **Special Interest Groups** - Join focused discussions on specific threat areas

### Knowledge Base
- **[Vulnerability Database](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/vulnerability-db)** - Comprehensive vulnerability information
- **[Audit Database](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/audit-db)** - Related security audit findings
