# Vulnerability Database

Security vulnerabilities and community-maintained advisory database for MCP servers and related infrastructure. This database helps track and manage security issues in the MCP ecosystem.

## Database Overview

### Purpose
- **Track Vulnerabilities** - Maintain a comprehensive database of MCP-related security issues
- **Share Intelligence** - Provide security intelligence to the community
- **Coordinate Response** - Help coordinate vulnerability disclosure and response
- **Improve Security** - Learn from past vulnerabilities to prevent future issues

### Coverage
- **MCP Servers** - Vulnerabilities in MCP server implementations
- **Dependencies** - Security issues in MCP server dependencies
- **Protocols** - Protocol-level security vulnerabilities
- **Integrations** - Security issues in MCP integrations and extensions

## Vulnerability Categories

### By Severity
- **Critical** - Immediate threat requiring urgent action
- **High** - Significant security risk requiring prompt attention
- **Medium** - Moderate risk requiring timely remediation
- **Low** - Minor security issues for future consideration

### By Type
- **Authentication** - Authentication bypass and credential issues
- **Authorization** - Access control and privilege escalation
- **Injection** - Code injection and command execution
- **Exposure** - Information disclosure and data exposure
- **Denial of Service** - Availability and resource exhaustion
- **Cryptographic** - Encryption and cryptographic weaknesses

### By Component
- **Server Core** - Core MCP server vulnerabilities
- **Extensions** - MCP extension and plugin vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies** - Third-party library vulnerabilities
- **Configuration** - Misconfiguration and deployment issues

## Using the Database

### Security Teams
1. **Monitor Advisories** - Subscribe to vulnerability notifications
2. **Assess Impact** - Evaluate vulnerability impact on your deployment
3. **Plan Response** - Develop remediation plans for identified vulnerabilities
4. **Track Progress** - Monitor vulnerability remediation status

### Developers
1. **Security Reviews** - Check for vulnerabilities in MCP servers you use
2. **Dependency Management** - Monitor dependencies for security issues
3. **Secure Development** - Learn from past vulnerabilities to improve security
4. **Testing** - Test for known vulnerabilities in your implementations

### Researchers
1. **Research Targets** - Identify areas needing security research
2. **Share Findings** - Contribute new vulnerability discoveries
3. **Coordinate Disclosure** - Follow responsible disclosure procedures
4. **Validate Fixes** - Verify vulnerability remediation effectiveness

## Contributing to the Database

### Vulnerability Reporting
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Follow proper vulnerability disclosure procedures
- **Detailed Reports** - Provide comprehensive vulnerability documentation
- **Proof of Concept** - Include safe proof-of-concept demonstrations
- **Remediation Guidance** - Suggest fixes and mitigations

### Database Maintenance
- **Verify Information** - Help validate vulnerability reports
- **Update Status** - Track vulnerability remediation progress
- **Improve Documentation** - Enhance vulnerability descriptions
- **Add Context** - Provide additional analysis and commentary

## Responsible Disclosure

### Reporting Process
1. **Private Disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Coordination** - Work with maintainers on disclosure timeline
3. **Public Disclosure** - Publish details after fixes are available
4. **Follow-up** - Monitor and assist with remediation efforts

### Timeline
- **Initial Report** - Private disclosure to maintainers
- **Acknowledgment** - Confirmation of vulnerability receipt
- **Investigation** - Vulnerability analysis and validation
- **Fix Development** - Remediation development and testing
- **Public Disclosure** - Public vulnerability advisory
