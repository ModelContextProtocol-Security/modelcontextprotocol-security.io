# Authentication & Authorization

Bypassing authentication and authorization controls in MCP systems, enabling unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

## Overview

Authentication and authorization attacks exploit weaknesses in identity verification and access control mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to MCP systems and resources.

## Attack Techniques

### [Unauthenticated Access](unauthenticated-access.md)
MCP endpoints exposed without proper authentication mechanisms.

### [Broken Authentication](broken-authentication.md)
Flawed authentication implementations allowing unauthorized access.

### [Authorization Bypass](authorization-bypass.md)
Circumvention of access controls to perform unauthorized actions.

### [Auth Bypass & Rogue Server Registration](auth-bypass-rogue-server.md)
Unauthorized server registration and unverified API usage.

### [Identity Subversion](identity-subversion.md)
Flaws allowing attackers to assume other identities or escalate privileges.

### [Session Management Issues](session-management-issues.md)
Problems with session handling, including session hijacking and fixation.

### [Privilege Escalation](privilege-escalation.md)
Gaining higher-level permissions than originally granted.

### [Audit Bypass](audit-bypass.md)
Lack of proper logging for delegated calls and missing audit trails.

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: Medium to Critical
- **Likelihood**: Medium to High
- **Detection Difficulty**: Medium

## Common Indicators

- Unauthenticated access attempts
- Unusual authentication patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Session anomalies
- Authorization bypass attempts

## General Mitigation Strategies

1. **Strong Authentication**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms
2. **Access Controls**: Deploy proper authorization systems
3. **Session Security**: Secure session management
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive authentication and authorization logging
5. **Identity Verification**: Verify user and system identities

## Detection Methods

- Authentication monitoring
- Authorization tracking
- Session analysis
- Identity verification
