# Authorization Bypass

**Category**: Authentication & Authorization  
**Severity**: High  

## Description

Circumvention of access controls to perform unauthorized actions, enabling attackers to bypass authorization mechanisms and access protected resources or functionality.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Authorization logic flaws
- Access control bypass
- Permission validation failures
- Role-based access control bypass

### Common Techniques
- Parameter manipulation
- HTTP method manipulation
- Path traversal
- Role confusion attacks

## Impact

- **Unauthorized Actions**: Performing actions beyond granted permissions
- **Data Access**: Access to restricted data and resources
- **Privilege Escalation**: Higher-level access through authorization bypass
- **System Compromise**: Control over protected functionality

## Detection Methods

### Authorization Monitoring
- Monitor authorization attempts
- Track permission checks
- Detect unauthorized access
- Analyze access patterns

### Access Control Analysis
- Monitor role assignments
- Track permission changes
- Detect access anomalies
- Analyze authorization decisions

## Mitigation Strategies

### Access Control Implementation
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Use role-based access control
- Deploy permission validation
- Monitor access attempts

### Security Controls
- Implement least privilege principles
- Use authorization logging
- Deploy access monitoring
- Monitor permission changes

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Parameter Manipulation
```python
def delete_user(user_id, requester_id):
    # Weak authorization check
    if requester_id == user_id:
        return delete_user_record(user_id)
    
    # Attack: manipulate user_id to match requester_id
    # delete_user(admin_user_id, admin_user_id)
```

### Example 2: Role Confusion
```python
def access_admin_panel(user_role):
    # Flawed role check
    if "admin" in user_role:
        return render_admin_panel()
    
    # Attack: user_role = "user_admin_viewer"
    # Contains "admin" but shouldn't grant access
```

### Example 3: HTTP Method Bypass
```python
@app.route('/api/users/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    # No authorization check for GET
    return get_user_data(user_id)

@app.route('/api/users/<user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
@require_admin
def delete_user(user_id):
    # Authorization required for DELETE
    return delete_user_data(user_id)

# Attack: Use GET to bypass authorization
```
