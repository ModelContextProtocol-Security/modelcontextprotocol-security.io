# Audit Bypass

**Category**: Authentication & Authorization  
**Severity**: Medium  

## Description

Lack of proper logging for delegated calls and missing audit trails, enabling attackers to perform actions without detection or accountability.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Missing audit logging
- Audit trail manipulation
- Log bypass techniques
- Accountability evasion

### Common Techniques
- Log suppression
- Audit trail tampering
- Logging bypass
- Event obfuscation

## Impact

- **Stealth Operations**: Actions performed without detection
- **Accountability Loss**: Inability to track malicious activities
- **Forensic Challenges**: Difficulty investigating security incidents
- **Compliance Violations**: Failure to meet audit requirements

## Detection Methods

### Audit Monitoring
- Monitor audit log generation
- Track logging patterns
- Detect missing audit entries
- Analyze audit completeness

### Log Analysis
- Analyze log integrity
- Monitor log tampering
- Detect log gaps
- Track logging anomalies

## Mitigation Strategies

### Audit Implementation
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Use tamper-proof logging
- Deploy audit monitoring
- Monitor audit completeness

### Log Security
- Implement log integrity protection
- Use centralized logging
- Deploy log monitoring
- Monitor log access

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Missing Audit Logging
```python
def execute_sensitive_action(action, user_id):
    # No audit logging
    result = perform_action(action)
    
    # Should include: audit_log(action, user_id, result)
    return result
```

### Example 2: Conditional Logging Bypass
```python
def admin_operation(operation, user_id, bypass_audit=False):
    if not bypass_audit:
        audit_log(operation, user_id)
    
    # Attack: bypass_audit=True to avoid logging
    return execute_admin_operation(operation)
```

### Example 3: Log Suppression
```python
def delegated_call(target_function, params, log_level="INFO"):
    # Logging bypass through level manipulation
    if log_level != "SILENT":
        log_function_call(target_function, params)
    
    # Attack: log_level="SILENT" to suppress logging
    return target_function(params)
```
