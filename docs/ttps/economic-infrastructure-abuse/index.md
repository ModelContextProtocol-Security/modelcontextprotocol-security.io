# Economic & Infrastructure Abuse

**Category Overview**: Techniques targeting economic exploitation and infrastructure abuse in MCP systems.

This category covers vulnerabilities related to resource abuse, economic exploitation, and infrastructure misuse that can lead to financial losses and system degradation.

## Techniques in this Category

1. **[Resource Exhaustion](resource-exhaustion.md)** - Consuming excessive system resources to degrade performance
2. **[API Rate Limit Bypass](api-rate-limit-bypass.md)** - Circumventing API rate limiting mechanisms
3. **[Computational Resource Abuse](computational-resource-abuse.md)** - Misusing computational resources for unauthorized purposes

## Common Attack Vectors

- **Resource Consumption**: Excessive use of system resources
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Circumventing usage restrictions
- **Computational Abuse**: Misusing processing power for unauthorized activities
- **Economic Exploitation**: Causing financial damage through resource abuse
- **Infrastructure Degradation**: Degrading system performance and availability
- **Service Disruption**: Disrupting normal service operations

## Impact Assessment

- **Financial Loss**: Direct costs from resource abuse and infrastructure damage
- **Performance Degradation**: Reduced system performance and user experience
- **Service Unavailability**: System outages and service disruptions
- **Resource Depletion**: Exhaustion of critical system resources
- **Operational Impact**: Disruption of normal business operations
- **Reputation Damage**: Loss of user trust and reputation
