# Resource Exhaustion

**Category**: Economic & Infrastructure Abuse  
**Severity**: High  

## Description

Consuming excessive system resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) to degrade system performance, cause service disruption, or increase operational costs.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Resource consumption attacks
- Memory exhaustion
- CPU overload
- Storage depletion
- Network bandwidth abuse

### Common Techniques
- Infinite loops and recursive calls
- Memory leaks and allocation bombs
- Large file operations
- Network flooding
- Database query abuse

## Impact

- **Service Degradation**: Reduced system performance and responsiveness
- **Service Unavailability**: System crashes and service outages
- **Financial Impact**: Increased infrastructure costs
- **User Experience**: Poor user experience and system instability

## Detection Methods

### Resource Monitoring
- Monitor CPU, memory, and storage usage
- Track resource consumption patterns
- Detect resource exhaustion attacks
- Monitor system performance metrics

### Performance Analysis
- Analyze system performance
- Track response times
- Monitor resource allocation
- Detect performance anomalies

## Mitigation Strategies

### Resource Management
- Implement resource limits and quotas
- Use resource monitoring systems
- Deploy auto-scaling mechanisms
- Monitor resource usage patterns

### Performance Protection
- Implement rate limiting
- Use circuit breakers
- Deploy load balancing
- Monitor system health

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Memory Exhaustion Attack
```python
# Vulnerable memory allocation
def process_large_data(data_size):
    # No memory limits
    large_buffer = bytearray(data_size)
    
    # Attacker requests huge buffer
    # data_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 10 GB
    
    # System runs out of memory
    return large_buffer
```

### Example 2: CPU Exhaustion Through Infinite Loop
```python
# Vulnerable processing function
def process_user_input(user_input):
    # No input validation
    iterations = int(user_input)
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(iterations):
        result += complex_calculation(i)
    
    # Attacker provides huge number
    # user_input = "999999999999"
    # Causes CPU exhaustion
    return result
```

### Example 3: Storage Exhaustion
```python
# Vulnerable file storage
def store_file(filename, content):
    # No size limits
    with open(f"/tmp/{filename}", "wb") as f:
        f.write(content)
    
    # Attacker uploads massive files
    # content = b"A" * (10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)  # 10 GB
    # Fills up storage
```
