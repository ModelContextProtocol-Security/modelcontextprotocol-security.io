# Insecure Communication

**Category**: Protocol Vulnerabilities  
**Severity**: High  

## Description

Unencrypted or poorly secured communication channels between MCP components, enabling attackers to intercept, monitor, or manipulate communications.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Unencrypted communication channels
- Weak encryption implementations
- Insecure protocol configurations
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

### Common Techniques
- Network traffic interception
- Protocol downgrade attacks
- Weak encryption exploitation
- Communication monitoring

## Impact

- **Data Interception**: Sensitive data intercepted during transmission
- **Communication Monitoring**: Unauthorized monitoring of MCP communications
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers positioned between communicating parties
- **Data Manipulation**: Modification of data in transit

## Detection Methods

### Network Monitoring
- Monitor network traffic patterns
- Detect unencrypted communications
- Analyze encryption usage
- Monitor communication security

### Protocol Analysis
- Analyze protocol security
- Test encryption implementations
- Monitor protocol configurations
- Detect communication vulnerabilities

## Mitigation Strategies

### Communication Security
- Implement encrypted communications
- Use secure protocols
- Deploy strong encryption
- Monitor communication security

### Protocol Hardening
- Harden communication protocols
- Implement secure configurations
- Deploy protocol monitoring
- Monitor protocol security

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Unencrypted Communication
```python
# Vulnerable unencrypted communication
def send_mcp_message(message, host, port):
    # No encryption
    socket = create_socket(host, port)
    socket.send(message.encode())
    response = socket.recv(1024)
    
    # Sensitive data transmitted in plaintext
    return response.decode()
```

### Example 2: Weak Encryption
```python
# Weak encryption implementation
def encrypt_message(message, key):
    # Weak encryption algorithm
    encrypted = simple_xor(message, key)
    return base64.encode(encrypted)

# Easily broken encryption
def decrypt_message(encrypted_message, key):
    decoded = base64.decode(encrypted_message)
    return simple_xor(decoded, key)
```

### Example 3: Protocol Downgrade Attack
```python
def establish_connection(host, port):
    # Vulnerable to downgrade attacks
    try:
        # Attempt secure connection
        return create_tls_connection(host, port)
    except:
        # Fall back to insecure connection
        return create_plain_connection(host, port)
    
    # Attacker forces fallback to insecure connection
```
