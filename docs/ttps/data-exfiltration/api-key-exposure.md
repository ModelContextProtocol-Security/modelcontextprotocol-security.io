# API Key Exposure

**Category**: Data Exfiltration & Credential Theft  
**Severity**: High  

## Description

Accidental or malicious exposure of API keys and secrets through MCP configurations, logs, or other storage mechanisms, enabling unauthorized access to protected services and APIs.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- API key exposure in configuration files
- Secrets in application logs
- Credential leakage through error messages
- Unsecured credential storage

### Common Techniques
- Configuration file analysis
- Log file harvesting
- Error message extraction
- Memory dumps analysis

## Impact

- **API Abuse**: Unauthorized access to external APIs
- **Service Compromise**: Access to protected services
- **Cost Implications**: Unauthorized API usage charges
- **Data Access**: Access to API-protected data

## Detection Methods

### Credential Scanning
- Scan configuration files for API keys
- Monitor log files for credential exposure
- Detect credential patterns in code
- Analyze error messages for secrets

### Access Monitoring
- Monitor API key usage patterns
- Track unusual API access
- Detect API abuse patterns
- Monitor service access

## Mitigation Strategies

### Credential Management
- Use secure credential storage
- Implement credential rotation
- Deploy secret management systems
- Monitor credential exposure

### Configuration Security
- Secure configuration files
- Use environment variables
- Implement configuration encryption
- Monitor configuration access

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Configuration File Exposure
```json
{
  "database": {
    "url": "postgresql://user:password@localhost/db"
  },
  "api_keys": {
    "openai": "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "aws": "AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Log File Credential Leakage
```
2024-01-15 10:30:15 INFO: Connecting to API with key: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2024-01-15 10:30:16 ERROR: Authentication failed for user: admin, password: secretpassword123
```

### Example 3: Error Message Exposure
```python
def connect_to_api():
    api_key = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    try:
        return api_client.connect(api_key)
    except Exception as e:
        # Credential leaked in error message
        raise Exception(f"API connection failed with key {api_key}: {str(e)}")
```
