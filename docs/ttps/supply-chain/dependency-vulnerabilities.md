# Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Category**: Supply Chain & Dependencies  
**Severity**: High  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1195.001 (Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools)

## Description

Security flaws in third-party libraries and dependencies used by MCP servers, enabling attackers to exploit vulnerable components to compromise MCP systems.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Vulnerable third-party libraries
- Outdated dependencies
- Insecure dependency configurations
- Transitive dependency vulnerabilities

### Common Techniques
- Known vulnerability exploitation
- Dependency confusion attacks
- Version downgrade attacks
- Transitive dependency exploitation

## Impact

- **Code Execution**: Arbitrary code execution through vulnerable dependencies
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data access through dependency flaws
- **System Compromise**: System access through dependency exploitation
- **Privilege Escalation**: Elevated access through dependency vulnerabilities

## Detection Methods

### Dependency Scanning
- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Monitor dependency versions
- Track security advisories
- Analyze dependency usage

### Vulnerability Monitoring
- Monitor vulnerability databases
- Track dependency security updates
- Detect vulnerable components
- Analyze security patches

## Mitigation Strategies

### Dependency Management
- Implement dependency scanning
- Use dependency pinning
- Deploy vulnerability monitoring
- Monitor dependency updates

### Security Updates
- Implement regular updates
- Use automated patching
- Deploy security monitoring
- Monitor vulnerability status

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Vulnerable Library Usage
```python
# Using vulnerable version of library
import requests_old_version  # Contains known RCE vulnerability

def fetch_data(url):
    # Vulnerable to remote code execution
    response = requests_old_version.get(url)
    return response.content
```

### Example 2: Transitive Dependency Vulnerability
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "mcp-tool": "1.0.0"
  }
}

// mcp-tool depends on vulnerable-lib 2.1.0
// vulnerable-lib has known security issues
// Vulnerability inherited through transitive dependency
```

### Example 3: Dependency Confusion
```python
# Legitimate internal dependency
import internal_mcp_utils

# Attacker creates public package with same name
# Package manager resolves to malicious public version
# import internal_mcp_utils  # Actually imports malicious version
```
