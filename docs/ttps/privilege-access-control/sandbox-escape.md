# Sandbox Escape

**Category**: Privilege & Access Control  
**Severity**: Critical  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1055 (Process Injection)

## Description

Breaking out of security sandboxes and containment mechanisms designed to isolate MCP tools and processes, enabling access to the broader system environment.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Sandbox implementation flaws
- Containment bypass techniques
- Security boundary violations
- Isolation mechanism failures

### Common Techniques
- Container escape techniques
- Virtual machine breakout
- Process isolation bypass
- Security boundary violations

## Impact

- **System Access**: Breaking out of containment to access host system
- **Security Bypass**: Circumventing security isolation mechanisms
- **Lateral Movement**: Accessing systems outside the sandbox
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges outside containment

## Detection Methods

### Sandbox Monitoring
- Monitor sandbox integrity
- Detect escape attempts
- Track containment violations
- Analyze sandbox behavior

### System Monitoring
- Monitor system activities
- Track process behavior
- Detect privilege escalation
- Analyze system integrity

## Mitigation Strategies

### Sandbox Security
- Harden sandbox implementations
- Implement strong isolation
- Deploy escape detection
- Regular security updates

### Containment Controls
- Implement multi-layered containment
- Use secure isolation mechanisms
- Deploy monitoring systems
- Regular security audits

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Container Escape via Mount Points
```python
# Vulnerable container configuration
import os
import subprocess

def execute_in_container(command):
    # Weak container isolation
    container_config = {
        "mounts": [
            {"source": "/", "target": "/host", "type": "bind"}
        ]
    }
    
    # Attacker escapes via host mount
    # command = "chroot /host /bin/bash"
    subprocess.run(["docker", "run", "--privileged", "-v", "/:/host", "image", command])
```

### Example 2: Process Namespace Escape
```python
# Vulnerable process isolation
import os

def create_sandbox():
    # Weak process isolation
    pid = os.fork()
    
    if pid == 0:
        # Child process in "sandbox"
        # Insufficient namespace isolation
        os.execv("/bin/sh", ["sh"])
    else:
        # Parent process
        os.waitpid(pid, 0)
    
    # Attacker breaks out of weak isolation
    # Access to parent process namespace
```

### Example 3: File System Escape
```python
# Vulnerable file system containment
import os

class SandboxFileSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.jail_dir = "/tmp/sandbox"
        
    def access_file(self, path):
        # Insufficient path validation
        full_path = os.path.join(self.jail_dir, path)
        
        # Vulnerable to path traversal
        if os.path.exists(full_path):
            return open(full_path, 'r').read()
        
        # Attacker escapes sandbox
        # path = "../../../../etc/passwd"
```
