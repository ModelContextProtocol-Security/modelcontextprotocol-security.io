# Process Injection

**Category**: Privilege & Access Control  
**Severity**: Critical  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1055 (Process Injection)

## Description

Injecting malicious code into legitimate MCP processes to execute with the privileges of the target process, enabling privilege escalation and system compromise.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Process memory manipulation
- Code injection techniques
- Dynamic library injection
- Process hollowing attacks

### Common Techniques
- DLL injection
- Process hollowing
- Thread execution hijacking
- Memory patching

## Impact

- **Privilege Escalation**: Executing with target process privileges
- **System Compromise**: Complete system takeover
- **Stealth Execution**: Hidden malicious code execution
- **Security Bypass**: Bypassing security controls

## Detection Methods

### Process Monitoring
- Monitor process behavior
- Track process injection attempts
- Detect unusual process activities
- Analyze process integrity

### Memory Monitoring
- Monitor memory modifications
- Track code injection
- Detect memory manipulation
- Analyze memory integrity

## Mitigation Strategies

### Process Protection
- Implement process isolation
- Use code signing
- Deploy process monitoring
- Regular integrity checks

### Memory Protection
- Implement memory protection
- Use address space layout randomization
- Deploy memory monitoring
- Monitor code execution

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: DLL Injection Attack
```python
# Vulnerable process allowing DLL injection
import ctypes
import os

def load_plugin(plugin_path):
    # Insufficient validation of plugin path
    if os.path.exists(plugin_path):
        # Loads arbitrary DLL
        library = ctypes.CDLL(plugin_path)
        return library.initialize()
    
    # Attacker injects malicious DLL
    # plugin_path = "C:\\malicious.dll"
```

### Example 2: Process Memory Manipulation
```python
# Vulnerable process memory handling
import mmap
import struct

class MCPProcessManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processes = {}
    
    def inject_code(self, process_id, code):
        # Insufficient validation
        if process_id in self.processes:
            process = self.processes[process_id]
            
            # Directly writes to process memory
            process.memory.write(code)
            process.memory.flush()
        
        # Attacker injects malicious code
        # code = shellcode_payload
```

### Example 3: Thread Hijacking
```python
# Vulnerable thread management
import threading

class MCPThreadManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threads = {}
    
    def create_thread(self, thread_id, target_function):
        # Insufficient validation of target function
        thread = threading.Thread(target=target_function)
        self.threads[thread_id] = thread
        thread.start()
    
    def hijack_thread(self, thread_id, new_function):
        # Vulnerable: allows thread hijacking
        if thread_id in self.threads:
            thread = self.threads[thread_id]
            # Modifies thread execution
            thread._target = new_function
        
        # Attacker hijacks legitimate thread
        # new_function = malicious_payload
```
