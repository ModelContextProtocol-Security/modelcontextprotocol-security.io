# Excessive Tool Permissions

**Category**: Privilege & Access Control  
**Severity**: High  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1134 (Access Token Manipulation)

## Description

Tools granted overly broad permissions that exceed their functional requirements, creating opportunities for privilege abuse and unauthorized access to system resources.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Over-privileged tool configurations
- Excessive permission grants
- Broad access policies
- Unrestricted tool capabilities

### Common Techniques
- Tool permission abuse
- Excessive privilege exploitation
- Broad access exploitation
- Permission escalation through tools

## Impact

- **Unauthorized Access**: Tools accessing resources beyond their scope
- **Data Exposure**: Excessive permissions leading to data access
- **System Compromise**: Tools with system-level permissions
- **Lateral Movement**: Using over-privileged tools for further attacks

## Detection Methods

### Permission Auditing
- Audit tool permissions
- Monitor permission usage
- Detect excessive access
- Track privilege escalation

### Tool Monitoring
- Monitor tool activities
- Track resource access
- Detect permission abuse
- Analyze tool behavior

## Mitigation Strategies

### Permission Management
- Implement least privilege principles
- Regular permission audits
- Restrict tool capabilities
- Monitor permission usage

### Tool Security
- Limit tool permissions
- Implement access controls
- Deploy monitoring systems
- Regular security reviews

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: File System Tool with Excessive Permissions
```python
# Over-privileged file tool
class FileReaderTool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Excessive permissions - full filesystem access
        self.permissions = ["read", "write", "execute", "delete"]
        self.allowed_paths = ["/"]  # Root access
    
    def read_file(self, path):
        # Should be restricted to specific directories
        if self.has_permission("read"):
            return open(path, 'r').read()
        
        # Attacker reads sensitive files
        # path = "/etc/passwd"
```

### Example 2: Network Tool with Broad Access
```python
# Over-privileged network tool
class NetworkTool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Excessive network permissions
        self.allowed_protocols = ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "FTP", "SSH", "TELNET"]
        self.allowed_ports = range(1, 65536)  # All ports
        self.allowed_hosts = ["*"]  # All hosts
    
    def connect(self, host, port, protocol):
        # Should be restricted to specific services
        return establish_connection(host, port, protocol)
        
        # Attacker connects to internal services
        # host = "internal-database", port = 3306
```

### Example 3: System Tool with Admin Access
```python
# Over-privileged system tool
class SystemTool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Excessive system permissions
        self.permissions = [
            "process_management",
            "user_management", 
            "system_configuration",
            "service_control"
        ]
    
    def execute_command(self, command):
        # Should be restricted to specific commands
        if "system_configuration" in self.permissions:
            return os.system(command)
        
        # Attacker executes arbitrary system commands
        # command = "adduser attacker sudo"
```
