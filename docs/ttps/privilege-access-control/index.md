# Privilege & Access Control

**Category Overview**: Techniques targeting privilege escalation and access control weaknesses in MCP systems.

This category covers vulnerabilities related to unauthorized privilege escalation, access control bypass, and unauthorized access to system resources.

## Techniques in this Category

1. **[Unauthorized Privilege Escalation](unauthorized-privilege-escalation.md)** - Exploiting flaws to gain elevated system privileges
2. **[Excessive Tool Permissions](excessive-tool-permissions.md)** - Exploiting overly broad tool access permissions
3. **[Sandbox Escape](sandbox-escape.md)** - Breaking out of security sandboxes and containment
4. **[Resource Access Control Bypass](resource-access-control-bypass.md)** - Bypassing access controls for protected resources
5. **[Cross-Context Access](cross-context-access.md)** - Unauthorized access across different security contexts
6. **[Process Injection](process-injection.md)** - Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes

## Common Attack Vectors

- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges
- **Access Control Bypass**: Circumventing security controls and permissions
- **Sandbox Escape**: Breaking out of security containment mechanisms
- **Resource Access**: Unauthorized access to system resources and data
- **Cross-Context Attacks**: Accessing resources across security boundaries
- **Process Manipulation**: Injecting code into legitimate system processes

## Impact Assessment

- **System Compromise**: Complete system takeover through privilege escalation
- **Data Access**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources
- **Security Bypass**: Circumventing security controls and protections
- **System Integrity**: Compromise of system integrity and security
- **Operational Impact**: Disruption of normal system operations
- **Escalation Potential**: Foundation for further attacks and system compromise
