# AI-Specific Vulnerabilities

**Category Overview**: Techniques targeting AI-specific vulnerabilities and model-related security issues in MCP systems.

This category covers vulnerabilities unique to AI systems, including model manipulation, inference attacks, and AI-specific exploitation techniques that target machine learning models and AI infrastructure.

## Techniques in this Category

1. **[Model Poisoning](model-poisoning.md)** - Corrupting AI models through malicious training data or updates
2. **[Inference Attacks](inference-attacks.md)** - Extracting sensitive information through model inference
3. **[Model Theft](model-theft.md)** - Unauthorized extraction and replication of AI models
4. **[Adversarial Attacks](adversarial-attacks.md)** - Using adversarial inputs to manipulate AI model behavior

## Common Attack Vectors

- **Model Manipulation**: Corrupting or manipulating AI model behavior
- **Data Poisoning**: Injecting malicious data into training processes
- **Inference Exploitation**: Exploiting model inference to extract information
- **Model Extraction**: Unauthorized copying and theft of AI models
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Using crafted inputs to manipulate model outputs
- **AI Infrastructure Attacks**: Targeting AI-specific infrastructure components

## Impact Assessment

- **Model Compromise**: Corruption of AI model integrity and performance
