# Adversarial Attacks

**Category**: AI-Specific Vulnerabilities  
**Severity**: High  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1499.004 (Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation)

## Description

Using carefully crafted adversarial inputs to manipulate AI model behavior, cause misclassification, or trigger unexpected responses, potentially compromising system security and reliability.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Adversarial input generation
- Model behavior manipulation
- Evasion attacks
- Poisoning attacks

### Common Techniques
- Gradient-based attacks
- Optimization-based attacks
- Transfer attacks
- Physical adversarial attacks

## Impact

- **Model Manipulation**: Forcing incorrect model outputs and decisions
- **System Compromise**: Bypassing AI-based security controls
- **Decision Corruption**: Corrupting AI-powered decision-making processes
- **Security Bypass**: Evading AI-based detection and prevention systems

## Detection Methods

### Input Validation
- Monitor input patterns for adversarial characteristics
- Detect statistical anomalies in inputs
- Analyze input-output correlations
- Monitor model confidence scores

### Model Monitoring
- Monitor model behavior for anomalies
- Track prediction confidence patterns
- Detect unusual model responses
- Analyze model performance metrics

## Mitigation Strategies

### Input Protection
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use adversarial detection systems
- Deploy input preprocessing
- Monitor input patterns

### Model Robustness
- Implement adversarial training
- Use robust model architectures
- Deploy ensemble methods
- Monitor model performance

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Gradient-Based Adversarial Attack
```python
# Vulnerable model without adversarial protection
class VulnerableClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_classifier()
    
    def classify(self, input_data):
        # No adversarial detection
        return self.model.predict(input_data)

# Adversarial attack generation
def generate_adversarial_example(model, input_data, target_class):
    # Calculate gradients
    gradients = model.get_gradients(input_data)
    
    # Generate adversarial perturbation
    epsilon = 0.01
    perturbation = epsilon * sign(gradients)
    
    # Create adversarial example
    adversarial_input = input_data + perturbation
    
    # Verify attack success
    prediction = model.classify(adversarial_input)
    if prediction == target_class:
        return adversarial_input
    else:
        return None
```

### Example 2: Evasion Attack
```python
# Vulnerable spam detection system
class SpamDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_spam_model()
    
    def detect_spam(self, email_content):
        # No adversarial protection
        features = extract_features(email_content)
        spam_score = self.model.predict(features)
        
        return spam_score > 0.5

# Adversarial evasion attack
def evade_spam_detection(detector, spam_email):
    # Start with spam email
    modified_email = spam_email
    
    # Iteratively modify email to evade detection
    for i in range(100):
        spam_score = detector.detect_spam(modified_email)
        
        if not spam_score:
            # Successfully evaded detection
            return modified_email
        
        # Modify email slightly
        modified_email = apply_evasion_technique(modified_email)
    
    return None
```

### Example 3: Physical Adversarial Attack
```python
# Vulnerable image recognition system
class ImageRecognizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_image_model()
    
    def recognize_object(self, image):
        # No adversarial protection
        preprocessed = preprocess_image(image)
        prediction = self.model.predict(preprocessed)
        
        return get_class_name(prediction)

# Physical adversarial attack
def create_adversarial_patch(model, target_class):
    # Generate adversarial patch
    patch = initialize_random_patch()
    
    for epoch in range(1000):
        # Test patch on various backgrounds
        for background in test_backgrounds:
            # Apply patch to background
            modified_image = apply_patch(background, patch)
            
            # Get prediction
            prediction = model.recognize_object(modified_image)
            
            # Update patch to fool classifier
            if prediction != target_class:
                patch = update_patch(patch, model, target_class)
    
    return patch
```
