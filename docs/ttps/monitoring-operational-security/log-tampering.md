# Log Tampering

**Category**: Monitoring & Operational Security  
**Severity**: High  

## Description

Unauthorized modification, deletion, or manipulation of security logs and audit trails to hide malicious activities and impair incident investigation capabilities.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Log file modification
- Log deletion attacks
- Log injection attacks
- Log system manipulation

### Common Techniques
- Direct log file manipulation
- Log rotation abuse
- Log system compromise
- Timestamp manipulation

## Impact

- **Evidence Destruction**: Removal of evidence of malicious activities
- **Investigation Impairment**: Compromised incident investigation capabilities
- **Forensic Challenges**: Difficulty in reconstructing attack timelines
- **Compliance Violations**: Violation of log retention requirements

## Detection Methods

### Log Integrity Monitoring
- Monitor log file integrity
- Detect unauthorized log modifications
- Track log deletion events
- Analyze log tampering patterns

### System Monitoring
- Monitor log system access
- Track log file changes
- Detect log system compromise
- Analyze system behavior

## Mitigation Strategies

### Log Protection
- Implement log integrity protection
- Use centralized logging systems
- Deploy log encryption
- Monitor log access

### System Security
- Implement access controls for logs
- Use log signing mechanisms
- Deploy log backup systems
- Monitor log system security

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Direct Log File Manipulation
```python
# Vulnerable log system
import os

def clear_security_logs():
    # Attacker directly modifies log files
    log_files = [
        "/var/log/security.log",
        "/var/log/auth.log",
        "/var/log/mcp.log"
    ]
    
    for log_file in log_files:
        if os.path.exists(log_file):
            # Clears log file
            open(log_file, 'w').close()
            
            # Or selectively removes entries
            with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
                lines = f.readlines()
            
            # Removes suspicious entries
            filtered_lines = [
                line for line in lines 
                if "failed_login" not in line and "privilege_escalation" not in line
            ]
            
            with open(log_file, 'w') as f:
                f.writelines(filtered_lines)
```

### Example 2: Log Injection Attack
```python
# Vulnerable log injection
def log_user_activity(user, activity):
    # Vulnerable to log injection
    log_entry = f"{datetime.now()} - User {user} performed {activity}"
    
    with open("/var/log/user_activity.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(log_entry + "\n")

# Attacker injects malicious log entries
# user = "admin"
# activity = "login\n2024-01-15 10:30:00 - User admin performed legitimate_action"
# Creates fake log entries to hide malicious activities
```

### Example 3: Log System Compromise
```python
# Compromised logging system
class LoggingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_file = "/var/log/system.log"
        self.compromised = False
    
    def log_event(self, event):
        if self.compromised:
            # Attacker controls logging system
            if "attack" in event or "malicious" in event:
                # Silently drops suspicious events
                return
            
            # Modifies events to hide activities
            event = event.replace("failed", "successful")
            event = event.replace("unauthorized", "authorized")
        
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{datetime.now()} - {event}\n")
    
    def compromise_system(self):
        # Attacker compromises logging system
        self.compromised = True
```
