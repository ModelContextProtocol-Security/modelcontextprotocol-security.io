# Inadequate Monitoring

**Category**: Monitoring & Operational Security  
**Severity**: High  
**MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools)

## Description

Insufficient monitoring of system activities, security events, and user behaviors, creating opportunities for malicious activities to go undetected and compromising incident response capabilities.

## Technical Details

### Attack Vector
- Monitoring system gaps
- Insufficient event coverage
- Poor alert mechanisms
- Delayed detection systems

### Common Techniques
- Exploiting monitoring blind spots
- Operating during monitoring downtimes
- Avoiding monitored activities
- Timing attacks around monitoring

## Impact

- **Threat Detection Failures**: Malicious activities going undetected
- **Delayed Incident Response**: Late discovery of security incidents
- **Security Posture Degradation**: Reduced security visibility
- **Compliance Violations**: Failure to meet monitoring requirements

## Detection Methods

### Monitoring Assessment
- Assess monitoring coverage and effectiveness
- Identify monitoring gaps and blind spots
- Monitor system performance metrics
- Analyze alert generation patterns

### Security Analysis
- Analyze security event detection rates
- Monitor system behavior patterns
- Track monitoring system health
- Assess monitoring effectiveness

## Mitigation Strategies

### Monitoring Enhancement
- Implement comprehensive monitoring systems
- Use real-time monitoring tools
- Deploy automated alerting systems
- Monitor critical system components

### Security Operations
- Implement security operations center (SOC)
- Use security information and event management (SIEM)
- Deploy threat detection systems
- Monitor security metrics

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Missing Real-Time Monitoring
```python
# Inadequate monitoring system
class BasicMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []
    
    def log_event(self, event):
        # Only stores events, no real-time analysis
        self.events.append(event)
    
    def check_threats(self):
        # Manual threat checking - not real-time
        suspicious_events = []
        for event in self.events:
            if "failed_login" in event:
                suspicious_events.append(event)
        return suspicious_events

# Should implement real-time monitoring
class RealTimeMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []
        self.alert_thresholds = {
            "failed_login": 5,
            "privilege_escalation": 1,
            "data_access": 10
        }
    
    def log_event(self, event):
        self.events.append(event)
        self.analyze_event(event)
    
    def analyze_event(self, event):
        # Real-time threat analysis
        if self.is_suspicious(event):
            self.trigger_alert(event)
```

### Example 2: Insufficient System Monitoring
```python
# Basic system monitoring
def monitor_system():
    # Only checks basic metrics
    cpu_usage = get_cpu_usage()
    memory_usage = get_memory_usage()
    
    if cpu_usage > 80:
        print("High CPU usage")
    if memory_usage > 80:
        print("High memory usage")

# Should implement comprehensive monitoring
def monitor_system_comprehensive():
    metrics = {
        "cpu_usage": get_cpu_usage(),
        "memory_usage": get_memory_usage(),
        "disk_usage": get_disk_usage(),
        "network_activity": get_network_activity(),
        "process_count": get_process_count(),
        "active_connections": get_active_connections(),
        "failed_logins": get_failed_logins(),
        "privilege_escalations": get_privilege_escalations()
    }
    
    for metric, value in metrics.items():
        if is_anomalous(metric, value):
            trigger_alert(metric, value)
```

### Example 3: Missing Security Event Monitoring
```python
# Inadequate security monitoring
def handle_user_action(user, action):
    # Performs action without security monitoring
    result = execute_action(user, action)
    
    # Only logs basic information
    logger.info(f"User {user} performed {action}")
    
    return result

# Should implement security-focused monitoring
def handle_user_action_secure(user, action):
    # Pre-action security checks
    if is_suspicious_action(user, action):
        security_logger.warning(f"Suspicious action by {user}: {action}")
    
    result = execute_action(user, action)
    
    # Comprehensive security logging
    security_logger.info({
        "event": "user_action",
        "user": user,
        "action": action,
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "ip_address": get_user_ip(user),
        "user_agent": get_user_agent(user),
        "result": result
    })
    
    # Post-action security analysis
    analyze_user_behavior(user, action)
    
    return result
```
