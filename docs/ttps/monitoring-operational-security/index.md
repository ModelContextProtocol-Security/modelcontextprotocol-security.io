# Monitoring & Operational Security

**Category Overview**: Techniques targeting monitoring systems and operational security weaknesses in MCP environments.

This category covers vulnerabilities related to insufficient monitoring, logging failures, and operational security gaps that can hide malicious activities and prevent incident response.

## Techniques in this Category

1. **[Insufficient Logging](insufficient-logging.md)** - Inadequate logging of security events and activities
2. **[Missing Audit Trails](missing-audit-trails.md)** - Absence of comprehensive audit trails for security analysis
3. **[Inadequate Monitoring](inadequate-monitoring.md)** - Insufficient monitoring of system activities and security events
4. **[Log Tampering](log-tampering.md)** - Unauthorized modification or deletion of security logs
5. **[Blind Spots in Security](blind-spots-in-security.md)** - Unmonitored areas that can hide malicious activities

## Common Attack Vectors

- **Logging Bypass**: Avoiding detection through insufficient logging
- **Audit Trail Manipulation**: Modifying or deleting audit records
- **Monitoring Evasion**: Exploiting gaps in monitoring coverage
- **Log Destruction**: Destroying evidence of malicious activities
- **Security Blind Spots**: Exploiting unmonitored system areas

## Impact Assessment

- **Detection Evasion**: Malicious activities going undetected
- **Forensic Challenges**: Difficulty in incident investigation and response
- **Compliance Failures**: Violation of regulatory and compliance requirements
- **Security Visibility Loss**: Reduced visibility into security posture
- **Incident Response Impairment**: Hampered incident response capabilities
- **Accountability Loss**: Inability to track and attribute security events
