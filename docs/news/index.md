## 2025

### June 26, 2025 - Desktop Extensions Launch: Security Implications for One-Click MCP Installation

**Protocol Update** | **Medium Priority** | **Security Review Recommended**

Anthropic launched MCP Desktop Extensions, transforming MCP from complex developer setup to one-click installation for end users. While this dramatically improves usability, it introduces new security considerations for enterprise deployments.

**Key Security Features:**
- Enterprise-level security controls with Group Policy and MDM support
- Ability to pre-install approved extensions and blocklist specific publishers
- Sensitive data stored in OS keychain with automatic updates
- Supports private extension directories for organizations

**Security Implications:**
- Reduces technical barriers but increases attack surface
- Centralized extension management enables better security oversight
- Need for new security policies around extension approval processes

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Enterprise**: Implement extension approval workflows
2. **Review**: Audit installed extensions regularly
3. **Policy**: Establish guidelines for approved MCP extensions
4. **Monitor**: Set up alerts for unauthorized extension installations

### January 17, 2025 - Critical: 1,862 MCP Servers Exposed Without Authentication

**Security Research** | **High Priority** | **Immediate Action Required**

Security researchers at Knostic.ai have discovered 1,862 MCP servers exposed to the internet without authentication, with 100% of sampled servers (119/119) allowing unauthorized access to internal tool listings.

**Key Findings:**
- 1,862 MCP servers discoverable via Shodan search engine
- All 119 manually verified servers lacked authentication
- Servers vulnerable to data exfiltration, remote code execution, and credential theft
- Custom Python tooling developed for systematic discovery

**Security Implications:**
- Validates concerns about unauthenticated MCP deployments
- Demonstrates real-world exploitation potential at scale
- Highlights need for mandatory authentication in MCP implementations

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate**: Audit your MCP server deployments for internet exposure
2. **Urgent**: Implement authentication on all MCP servers
3. **Review**: Check if your servers appear in Shodan results
4. **Monitor**: Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts
