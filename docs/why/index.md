# Why MCP Security?

This page provides an executive overview of why Model Context Protocol (MCP) security matters for organizations deploying AI agents. MCP servers act as the bridge between AI agents and critical business systems, making them a high-value target for attackers and a critical component that requires proper security controls.

## The Problem

AI agents are rapidly moving from experimental chatbots to autonomous systems that can read files, make payments, provision cloud resources, and interact with sensitive APIs. Without proper security controls, these capabilities create unprecedented attack surfaces.

## The Solution

This resource provides practical, implementable security guidance based on real-world deployment experience and established security principles adapted for the AI agent era.

## Key Topics Covered

- Threat landscape analysis
- Business impact assessment
- Implementation roadmap
- ROI justification for security investments
