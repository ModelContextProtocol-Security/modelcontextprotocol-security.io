# Why MCP Security?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the de-facto adapter layer that enables autonomous AI agents to interact with APIs, services, and systems. However, this powerful capability introduces significant security challenges that organizations must address.

## The Security Challenge

MCP servers act as bridges between AI agents and external systems, potentially providing access to:
- **Sensitive Data**: Customer information, business intelligence, proprietary algorithms
- **Critical Systems**: Production databases, payment processors, infrastructure controls
- **External APIs**: Third-party services, cloud platforms, enterprise applications

Without proper security measures, MCP deployments can become significant attack vectors.

## Key Security Concerns

### 1. **Privilege Escalation**
AI agents with MCP access may gain unintended privileges through:
- Overly permissive MCP server configurations
- Inadequate access controls
- Lack of principle of least privilege enforcement

### 2. **Data Exposure**
Sensitive information can be compromised through:
- Insufficient data sanitization
- Inadequate logging and monitoring
- Lack of data classification and handling procedures

### 3. **Supply Chain Risks**
MCP servers from untrusted sources may introduce:
- Malicious code or backdoors
- Vulnerabilities and security flaws
- Dependency chain compromises

### 4. **Operational Security**
Production deployments face risks from:
- Inadequate network segmentation
- Insufficient monitoring and alerting
- Lack of incident response procedures
