# MCP Top 10 Security Risks

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem introduces unique security challenges that span both server and client implementations. To help organizations understand and address these risks, we've developed comprehensive Top 10 lists that cover the most critical security concerns in MCP deployments.

## Understanding MCP Security Risks

MCP security risks can be broadly categorized into two main areas:

### Server-Side Risks
Focus on backend systems, API security, infrastructure hardening, and service provision. These risks affect the core functionality and data processing capabilities of MCP servers.

### Client-Side Risks
Center on user interaction, local data protection, trust relationships, and the unique challenges of securing AI-integrated applications that connect to MCP servers.

## The Top 10 Lists

## Key Differences Between Server and Client Risks

### Server Risks Focus On:
- **Service provision** and backend API security
- **Infrastructure** security and system hardening
- **Multi-tenancy** and isolation between users
- **Protocol implementation** and specification compliance
- **Backend system** integration and data processing

### Client Risks Focus On:
- **User interaction** and deception through interfaces
- **Local data protection** and storage security
- **Trust relationships** with remote servers
- **UI/UX security** implications and user awareness
- **Client-side execution** environments and local attacks

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Prioritization
Each risk in our Top 10 lists is prioritized based on:
- **Likelihood** - How likely the risk is to occur in typical deployments
- **Impact** - The potential damage if the risk is exploited
- **Prevalence** - How common the vulnerability is across MCP implementations
- **Detectability** - How easy it is to identify and monitor for the risk

### Risk Categories
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Identity and access control issues
- **Data Protection** - Information disclosure and privacy concerns
- **Injection Attacks** - Code execution and manipulation vulnerabilities
- **Configuration Security** - Deployment and setup vulnerabilities
- **Communication Security** - Transport and protocol security issues

## Using These Lists

### For Security Teams
1. **Risk Assessment** - Use both lists to evaluate your complete MCP deployment
2. **Control Implementation** - Prioritize security controls based on your specific environment
3. **Monitoring Strategy** - Develop detection and monitoring approaches for high-priority risks
4. **Incident Response** - Prepare response procedures for the most critical scenarios

### For Development Teams
1. **Secure Development** - Build security into MCP applications from the start
2. **Code Review** - Use the lists as checklists during security code reviews
3. **Testing Strategy** - Develop test cases that validate security controls
4. **Documentation** - Document security implementations and decisions

### for Operations Teams
1. **Deployment Security** - Ensure secure deployment configurations
2. **Monitoring Implementation** - Set up monitoring for critical security events
3. **Maintenance Procedures** - Develop regular security maintenance tasks
4. **Training Programs** - Educate teams on MCP-specific security concerns

## Contributing to the Top 10 Lists
