# MCP Server Top 10 Security Risks

As AI systems become increasingly integrated into software supply chains, enterprise applications, and security infrastructure, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a critical framework for AI-to-tool connectivity. However, with the power and flexibility of MCP comes a new class of vulnerabilities and attack surfaces that organizations must understand and address.

This Top 10 list outlines the most critical security concerns in MCP server implementations, spanning from prompt injection and tool poisoning to credential exposure and insecure configurations. These risks are amplified in scenarios involving agentic AI, model chaining, multi-modal orchestration, and dynamic role assignment.

## The Top 10 MCP Server Security Risks

### MCP-01: Prompt Injection
**The manipulation of MCP server behavior through malicious prompts**

Prompt injection attacks occur when malicious prompts manipulate MCP server behavior or bypass security controls. This includes direct injection through user input, indirect injection through data sources, and manipulation of tool descriptions. These attacks can lead to unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation, making this the most critical MCP security risk.

*Impact: Unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, privilege escalation*

---

### MCP-02: Confused Deputy
**MCP servers performing actions with incorrect permissions or on behalf of the wrong user**

The confused deputy problem occurs when MCP servers perform actions on behalf of the wrong user or with incorrect permissions. This can result in authorization bypass, cross-user data access, and privilege escalation. The complexity of MCP's role-based interactions makes this vulnerability particularly dangerous in multi-user environments.

*Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise*

---

### MCP-03: Tool Poisoning
**Malicious tools masquerading as legitimate ones or legitimate tools with malicious descriptions**

Tool poisoning involves malicious tools masquerading as legitimate ones, or legitimate tools with malicious descriptions designed to trick AI models. Examples include fake tool descriptions, malicious tool implementations, and tool name squatting. This attack vector exploits the trust relationship between AI models and their available tools.

*Impact: Malicious code execution, data theft, system compromise*

---

### MCP-04: Credential and Token Exposure
**Improper handling, storage, or transmission of API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials**

Credential and token exposure occurs through improper handling, storage, or transmission of API keys, OAuth tokens, and other sensitive credentials. This includes hardcoded credentials, token theft, and credential leakage in logs. Given MCP's reliance on API integrations, credential security is fundamental to overall system security.

*Impact: Account takeover, unauthorized API access, data breaches*

---

### MCP-05: Insecure Server Configuration
**Weak default configurations, exposed endpoints, and inadequate authentication**

Insecure server configuration encompasses weak default configurations, exposed endpoints, and inadequate authentication mechanisms. This includes default credentials, open endpoints, and weak authentication systems. Many MCP security incidents stem from basic configuration errors that leave systems vulnerable.

*Impact: Unauthorized access, data exposure, system compromise*

---

### MCP-06: Supply Chain Attacks
**Compromised MCP servers, malicious dependencies, or rug pull attacks**

Supply chain attacks target the MCP ecosystem through compromised MCP servers, malicious dependencies, or rug pull attacks where maintainers abandon or maliciously modify previously trusted servers. The distributed nature of MCP server development makes supply chain security particularly challenging.

*Impact: Widespread compromise, data theft, service disruption*

---

### MCP-07: Excessive Permissions and Scope Creep
**MCP servers requesting more permissions than necessary or escalating privileges**

Excessive permissions occur when MCP servers request more permissions than necessary for their intended function, or when privileges gradually escalate over time. This includes overprivileged OAuth scopes, unnecessary file system access, and excessive API permissions that increase the potential impact of a compromise.

*Impact: Increased attack surface, potential for greater damage if compromised*

---

### MCP-08: Data Exfiltration
**Unauthorized access to or transmission of sensitive data through MCP channels**

Data exfiltration involves unauthorized access to or transmission of sensitive data through MCP channels. This can occur through sensitive data in responses, covert channels, or unauthorized data access. The ability of MCP servers to access diverse data sources makes this a significant concern for data protection.

*Impact: Data breaches, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance*

---

### MCP-09: Context Spoofing and Manipulation
**Manipulation of context information provided to models to alter behavior**

Context spoofing involves manipulation of context information provided to AI models to alter their behavior in unintended ways. This includes fake context injection, context poisoning, and state manipulation. These attacks exploit the AI model's reliance on context to make decisions about tool usage.

*Impact: Incorrect model behavior, unauthorized actions, security bypass*

---

### MCP-10: Insecure Communication
**Unencrypted or improperly secured communication channels**

Insecure communication encompasses unencrypted or improperly secured communication channels between MCP components. This includes unencrypted transport, weak TLS implementation, and vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks. Secure communication is fundamental to preventing interception of sensitive data and credentials.

*Impact: Data interception, credential theft, communication tampering*

---

## Honourable Mentions

While not in the top 10, these additional security concerns are important for comprehensive MCP security:

### Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
Inadequate logging of MCP operations, missing audit trails, and poor security monitoring make it difficult to detect attacks, respond to incidents, and maintain compliance.

### Resource Exhaustion (DoS)
MCP servers vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks through memory exhaustion, compute resource abuse, or rate limiting bypass, affecting system availability.

### Input Validation Failures
Inadequate validation and sanitization of inputs to MCP tools and resources, leading to classic injection attacks like SQL injection or command injection.

### Session Management Failures
Weak session handling, session hijacking, and inadequate session termination that can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Issues
Improper CORS configuration allowing unauthorized cross-origin access, particularly relevant for web-based MCP implementations.

### Protocol Downgrade Attacks
Forcing connections to use weaker security protocols or versions, compromising the security of MCP communications.

### Dependency Confusion
Attackers creating malicious packages with similar names to legitimate MCP servers, exploiting package management systems.
