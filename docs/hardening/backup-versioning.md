# Backup & Versioning

This section ensures the availability and recoverability of critical MCP components including AI-generated prompts, model configurations, and runtime data through comprehensive backup and versioning strategies.

## Key Practices

- Implement immutable artifact storage for prompts and model configurations
- Schedule regular snapshots of agent working directories
- Pin MCP server container images by cryptographic digest
- Version control all configuration and policy files
- Test backup restoration procedures regularly

## Implementation Guide

This section will provide:
- Backup architecture design for AI agent environments
- Version control strategies for AI-generated content
- Container image management and pinning procedures
- Automated backup and recovery testing
- Integration with existing backup infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses threats including data loss, system corruption, ransomware attacks, and the inability to recover from security incidents or system failures.
