# Pillar 4: Traffic Mediation

This pillar focuses on implementing visibility and control over MCP server network communications through API gateways, proxies, and network monitoring to detect and prevent malicious activity.

## Key Practices

- Route outbound calls through API gateways like Kong
- Log request/response metadata for all MCP communications
- Apply rate limiting, schema validation, and cost controls
- Implement traffic inspection and anomaly detection
- Establish network segmentation and egress filtering

## Implementation Guide

This section will provide:
- API gateway configuration for MCP traffic
- Logging and monitoring setup for network communications
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention strategies
- Network segmentation architectures
- Integration with SIEM and security monitoring tools

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses threats including data exfiltration, command and control communications, denial of service attacks, and unauthorized access to external services.
