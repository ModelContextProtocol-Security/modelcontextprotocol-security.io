# Pillar 2: Code Integrity & Auditing

This pillar covers the systematic review and validation of MCP server code to identify security vulnerabilities, backdoors, and quality issues before deployment.

## Key Practices

- Treat every MCP server as untrusted code requiring review
- Run static code analysis and dependency scanning
- Enforce signed commits and supply chain attestation
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Document audit findings and remediation steps

## Implementation Guide

This section will provide:
- Code review checklists specific to MCP servers
- Static analysis tool configurations (Semgrep, CodeQL)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning setup
- Supply chain security verification processes
- Integration with existing security toolchains

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses threats including hidden backdoors, vulnerable dependencies, malicious code injection, and poor coding practices that create security vulnerabilities.
