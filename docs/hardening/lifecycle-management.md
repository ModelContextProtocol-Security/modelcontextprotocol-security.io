# Lifecycle Management

This section establishes secure lifecycle management for MCP servers including update procedures, deprecation processes, and retirement strategies to maintain security over time while avoiding disruption to AI agent operations.

## Key Practices

- Implement explicit no-auto-update policies with controlled update procedures
- Use CI/CD pipelines to rebuild and test updated MCP containers
- Monitor upstream repository activity and archive stale projects
- Create deprecation timelines and migration paths
- Maintain security patching schedules and emergency update procedures

## Implementation Guide

This section will provide:
- Secure update workflow design and implementation
- Dependency monitoring and vulnerability management
- Retirement planning and data migration procedures
- Emergency patching and incident response procedures
- Long-term maintenance and support strategies

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses threats including vulnerable dependencies, abandoned software, supply chain attacks through updates, and operational disruption from uncontrolled changes to critical MCP components.
