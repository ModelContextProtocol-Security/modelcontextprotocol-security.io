# Policy & Guardrails

This section implements dynamic security controls that allow AI agents to negotiate permissions and justify actions while maintaining security boundaries through policy engines and human-in-the-loop approvals.

## Key Practices

- Embed policy engines (OPA/Cedar) in MCP wrappers
- Enable "explain" queries for AI agents to justify risky actions
- Implement cost and sensitivity thresholds for human approval
- Design negotiation protocols for security decisions
- Create audit trails for policy decisions and overrides

## Implementation Guide

This section will provide:
- Policy engine integration patterns
- Negotiation protocol design and implementation
- Human approval workflow automation
- Risk scoring and threshold configuration
- Policy testing and validation procedures

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses the limitations of static security controls by enabling context-aware decision making while preventing AI agents from bypassing security boundaries through social engineering or policy confusion.
