# Secrets & Credential Management

This section addresses the secure management of API keys, credentials, and sensitive configuration data used by MCP servers and AI agents, preventing credential theft and unauthorized access.

## Key Practices

- Use short-lived workload identities (SPIFFE JWT-SVID) for service authentication
- Never embed API keys in configuration files or container images
- Implement credential rotation and expiration policies
- Use separate wallets per agent with spending limits
- Apply principle of least privilege to credential scope

## Implementation Guide

This section will cover:
- Secrets management system integration (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Workload identity and service mesh authentication
- Credential rotation automation
- Wallet security for cryptocurrency and payment integrations
- Audit logging for credential access

## Risk Mitigation

Addresses threats including credential theft, unauthorized API access, financial fraud, and privilege escalation through compromised service accounts.
