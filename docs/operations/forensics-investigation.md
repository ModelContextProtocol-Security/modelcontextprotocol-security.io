# Forensics & Investigation

This guide provides comprehensive procedures for collecting evidence and conducting forensic investigations in Model Context Protocol (MCP) environments. Proper forensic procedures are essential for understanding security incidents and supporting legal or compliance requirements.

## Community Discussion

ðŸ’¬ **[Forensics & Investigation Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share forensic techniques, investigation methodologies, and evidence collection strategies with the security community.

## MCP-Specific Forensic Challenges

### AI Agent Forensics
- **Agent Decision Analysis** - Understanding AI agent decision-making processes
- **Prompt History Investigation** - Analyzing prompt injection and manipulation attempts
- **Agent Behavior Timeline** - Reconstructing agent activities and decisions
