# Operations Guide

This section provides comprehensive guidance for securely operating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in production environments. While our hardening guide covers deployment security, this operations guide focuses on the technical operational practices needed to run MCP servers securely day-to-day, including containerization, network controls, traffic mediation, and monitoring.

## Community Discussion

## Why Technical Operations Security Matters

Operating MCP servers securely requires specific technical knowledge about:

### Network Security Challenges
- **TLS Encryption Everywhere** - Most MCP traffic is encrypted, making traditional network monitoring ineffective
- **Agent-to-Service Communication** - AI agents communicate with multiple external services via HTTPS
- **Traffic Inspection Limitations** - Standard network security tools can't inspect encrypted payloads
- **API Proxy Necessity** - MCP servers need API proxies for visibility and control over outbound traffic

### Container & Runtime Security
- **Dockerization Benefits** - Containerizing MCP servers provides isolation and consistent deployment
- **Runtime Protection** - Container security controls prevent privilege escalation and system compromise
- **Remote Operation** - MCP servers often run on remote infrastructure requiring specialized security controls
- **Resource Isolation** - Proper container configuration prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Operational Complexity
- **Multi-Service Architecture** - MCP servers typically integrate with multiple external services
- **Dynamic Configuration** - AI agents may require runtime configuration changes
- **Scaling Challenges** - Security controls must work across horizontally scaled deployments
- **Performance Requirements** - Security controls cannot significantly impact AI agent response times

## Key Technical Concepts

### API Gateway Architecture
Since most MCP traffic is TLS-encrypted and uninspectable at the network level, **API gateways are essential** for:
- **Traffic Visibility** - Decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt traffic to external services
- **Policy Enforcement** - Apply security policies to API calls before they reach external services
- **Rate Limiting** - Control API usage to prevent abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Audit Logging** - Log all API interactions for security monitoring and compliance

### Network Traffic Redirection
**Code-level traffic redirection** is often more effective than network-level controls:
- **HTTP Client Wrapping** - Modify MCP server code to route traffic through security proxies
- **Environment Variables** - Use proxy environment variables to redirect traffic
- **iptables Rules** - Low-level network redirection for transparent proxying
- **Container Networking** - Use container networking to force traffic through security controls

### Container Security Operations
**Docker security** goes beyond basic containerization:
- **Minimal Base Images** - Use minimal, security-focused base images
- **Non-Root Execution** - Run MCP servers as non-root users in containers
- **Resource Limits** - Set CPU, memory, and network limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Security Scanning** - Regular vulnerability scanning of container images and dependencies
