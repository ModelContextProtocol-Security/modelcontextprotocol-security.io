# Operations Guide

Securely operating MCP servers in production environments requires specialized knowledge and procedures. This guide covers the operational aspects of MCP security, from container operations to incident response.

## Production Operations

### Container Operations
- **[Container Operations](container-operations.md)** - Dockerizing and containerizing MCP servers
- **[Remote Deployment](remote-deployment.md)** - Secure remote infrastructure deployment

### Network Security
- **[Network Controls](network-controls.md)** - iptables, network redirection, and traffic control
- **[API Gateway Operations](api-gateway-operations.md)** - Operating API gateways for traffic mediation
- **[Traffic Redirection](traffic-redirection.md)** - Wrapping code to redirect network traffic
- **[TLS & Proxy Management](tls-proxy-management.md)** - Managing TLS traffic and API proxies

### Monitoring & Response
- **[Security Monitoring & Alerting](monitoring-alerting.md)** - Production monitoring and alerting
- **[Incident Response](incident-response.md)** - MCP-specific incident response procedures
- **[Forensics & Investigation](forensics-investigation.md)** - Security incident investigation

### Operational Procedures
- **[Operational Maintenance](operational-maintenance.md)** - Regular security maintenance tasks
- **[Security Operations Workflows](security-workflows.md)** - Standardized operational procedures
- **[Change Management](change-management.md)** - Security-focused change management
- **[Operational Runbooks](operational-runbooks.md)** - Step-by-step operational procedures

### Performance & Optimization
- **[Performance & Security Optimization](performance-security.md)** - Balancing security and performance
- **[Security Troubleshooting](security-troubleshooting.md)** - Diagnosing security issues

## Getting Started

1. **Review Infrastructure** - Assess your current operational environment
2. **Implement Monitoring** - Set up security monitoring and alerting
3. **Create Procedures** - Develop operational security procedures
4. **Train Teams** - Educate operations staff on MCP security
5. **Test Response** - Validate incident response procedures

## Community Resources

- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Operations questions and discussions
- **[Working Group Meetings](../events/)** - Operations-focused sessions
- **[Community Guidelines](../community/)** - How to contribute operational knowledge
