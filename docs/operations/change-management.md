# Change Management

This guide provides security-focused change management procedures for Model Context Protocol (MCP) environments. Proper change management is essential for maintaining security while enabling necessary updates and improvements to MCP servers and AI agents.

## Community Discussion

ðŸ’¬ **[Change Management Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share change management processes, approval workflows, and lessons learned with the operations community.

## Security-Focused Change Management
