# Security Operations Workflows

This guide provides standardized workflows and procedures for common security operations tasks in Model Context Protocol (MCP) environments. These workflows ensure consistent, repeatable security operations across teams and environments.

## Community Discussion

ðŸ’¬ **[Security Workflows Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share workflow templates, process improvements, and automation strategies with the operations community.

## Core Security Workflows

### Daily Operations Workflows
- **Security Event Triage** - Standardized process for evaluating and prioritizing security alerts
- **Log Analysis Workflow** - Systematic approach to analyzing security logs for threats
- **Health Check Procedures** - Consistent verification of security control effectiveness
- **Anomaly Investigation** - Step-by-step process for investigating unusual system behavior

### Incident Response Workflows
- **Incident Classification** - Standardized categorization of security incidents
- **Evidence Collection** - Systematic collection and preservation of forensic evidence
- **Communication Protocols** - Clear procedures for incident communication and escalation
- **Recovery Procedures** - Standardized steps for system recovery and restoration

### Change Management Workflows
