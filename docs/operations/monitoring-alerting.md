# Security Monitoring & Alerting

This guide covers setting up comprehensive security monitoring and alerting systems for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in production environments. Effective monitoring is critical for detecting security threats, anomalies, and operational issues before they become incidents.

## Community Discussion

ðŸ’¬ **[Monitoring & Alerting Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ModelContextProtocol-Security/discussions)** - Share your monitoring configurations, alert rules, and detection strategies with the community.

## Monitoring Framework

### Core Security Metrics
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Failed login attempts, privilege escalation attempts, unusual access patterns
- **API Security** - Unusual request patterns, injection attempts, rate limiting violations
- **Resource Usage** - Abnormal CPU/memory usage, disk space issues, network anomalies
- **Configuration Changes** - Unauthorized modifications to MCP server configurations
- **Agent Behavior** - Unusual AI agent activity patterns, unexpected API calls

### Real-Time Alerting
- **Critical Security Events** - Immediate notification for high-severity security incidents
- **Anomaly Detection** - Automated detection of unusual patterns in MCP server behavior
- **Performance Degradation** - Alerts for performance issues that may indicate security problems
- **Compliance Violations** - Notifications for policy violations and compliance issues

## Implementation Guide

*This section will provide detailed implementation guidance for setting up security monitoring and alerting systems for MCP servers, including specific configurations for popular monitoring tools and platforms.*
