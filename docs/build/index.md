# Build Security

**Overview**: Security guidance for developing and deploying secure MCP implementations.

This section provides comprehensive security guidance for developers building MCP servers, clients, and tools. It covers secure architecture patterns, authentication strategies, runtime isolation, and security best practices for the development lifecycle.

## Core Build Security Topics

### Authentication & Authorization
- **[OAuth Security Patterns](oauth-security.md)** - Secure OAuth implementations for MCP
- **[Authentication Strategies](authentication-strategies.md)** - Alternative authentication schemes and patterns
- **[Zero Trust Architecture](zero-trust-architecture.md)** - Implementing zero trust principles

### Runtime Security
- **[Runtime Isolation](runtime-isolation.md)** - Sandboxing and privilege isolation techniques
- **[Architecture Patterns](architecture-patterns.md)** - Secure architectural design patterns
- **[Tool Metadata Specification](tool-metadata-spec.md)** - Formal metadata schema and validation

### Development Security
- **[Secure Development Practices](secure-development.md)** - Security-focused development lifecycle
- **[Code Security](code-security.md)** - Secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention
- **[Testing Security](testing-security.md)** - Security testing and validation approaches

## Build Security Principles

### Security by Design
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify and analyze potential security threats
- **Secure Defaults**: Implement secure default configurations
- **Least Privilege**: Apply minimal necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Layer multiple security controls

### Development Security
- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding standards and practices
- **Vulnerability Prevention**: Proactive security vulnerability prevention
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security testing throughout development
- **Supply Chain Security**: Secure dependencies and build processes

### Deployment Security
- **Secure Configuration**: Implement secure deployment configurations
- **Environment Hardening**: Harden deployment environments
- **Monitoring Integration**: Build in security monitoring capabilities
- **Incident Response**: Prepare for security incident response

## Security Integration

### CI/CD Security
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security scanning in build pipelines
- **Dependency Checking**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Security Testing**: Integrated security testing automation
- **Compliance Validation**: Automated compliance checking

### Quality Assurance
- **Security Reviews**: Mandatory security code reviews
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security penetration testing
- **Security Audits**: Comprehensive security audits
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular vulnerability assessments
