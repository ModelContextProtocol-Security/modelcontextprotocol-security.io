# Known Vulnerabilities

**Overview**: Documented security vulnerabilities in MCP implementations, tools, and infrastructure.

This section tracks real-world security vulnerabilities discovered in MCP systems, including CVEs, security advisories, and documented attack incidents.

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary code execution
- **Authentication Bypass**: Flaws that bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Privilege Escalation**: Vulnerabilities enabling privilege escalation

### High-Risk Vulnerabilities
- **Data Exfiltration**: Vulnerabilities enabling unauthorized data access
- **Session Hijacking**: Flaws allowing session takeover
- **Input Validation Bypass**: Vulnerabilities bypassing security controls

### Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities
- **Information Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities exposing sensitive information
- **Denial of Service**: Flaws causing service disruption
- **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigurations leading to security risks

## Tracking and Management

### Vulnerability Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: Vulnerability identification and initial assessment
2. **Disclosure**: Responsible disclosure to affected parties
3. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and severity rating
4. **Mitigation**: Temporary workarounds and fixes
5. **Patching**: Permanent fixes and updates
6. **Verification**: Confirmation of fix effectiveness

### Severity Ratings
- **Critical**: Immediate action required, high impact
- **High**: Prompt action needed, significant impact
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, should be addressed
- **Low**: Minor impact, can be addressed in regular cycle

## Current Vulnerability Status

### Active Vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- Unpatched critical and high-severity issues
- Ongoing security incidents

### Patched Vulnerabilities
- Resolved vulnerabilities with available fixes
- Historical vulnerability records
- Lessons learned and prevention measures
