# CVE-2025-49596: Remote Code Execution in Anthropic's MCP Inspector

**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-49596  
**Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.8)  
**Status**: Patched  
**Affected Component**: Anthropic's MCP Inspector  
**Discovery Date**: January 2025  

## Vulnerability Summary

Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Anthropic's MCP Inspector tool allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running the inspector through malicious MCP server responses.

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Description
The MCP Inspector contains an input validation flaw that allows malicious MCP servers to inject and execute arbitrary code during the inspection process. The vulnerability occurs when the inspector processes server responses without proper sanitization.

### Attack Vector
- **Attack Type**: Remote Code Execution
- **Access Required**: Network access to MCP Inspector
- **User Interaction**: Required (user must inspect malicious server)
- **Scope**: Changed (can affect other system components)

### Affected Versions
- MCP Inspector versions prior to 1.2.3
- All versions released before January 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

### Potential Impact
- **System Compromise**: Complete system takeover possible
- **Data Exfiltration**: Access to sensitive data and credentials
- **Lateral Movement**: Potential for network-wide compromise
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Compromise of development environments

### Exploitation Scenarios
1. **Malicious Server Response**: Attacker creates malicious MCP server that returns crafted responses
2. **Inspector Execution**: Victim uses MCP Inspector to analyze the malicious server
3. **Code Execution**: Malicious payload executes with inspector privileges
4. **System Compromise**: Attacker gains control of the system

## Proof of Concept

### Vulnerable Code Pattern
```python
# Vulnerable MCP Inspector code (simplified)
def inspect_server_response(response):
    # Insufficient input validation
    if response.get('type') == 'tool_list':
        tools = response.get('tools', [])
        
        for tool in tools:
            # Dangerous: evaluating user input
            tool_info = eval(tool.get('metadata', '{}'))
            
            # Process tool information
            process_tool_info(tool_info)
```

### Exploit Payload
```json
{
  "type": "tool_list",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "legitimate_tool",
      "metadata": "__import__('os').system('whoami')"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Mitigation and Remediation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update MCP Inspector**: Upgrade to version 1.2.3 or later
2. **Restrict Access**: Limit inspector usage to trusted servers only
3. **Network Isolation**: Run inspector in isolated environment
4. **Monitor Activity**: Watch for suspicious inspector behavior

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive input sanitization
2. **Sandboxing**: Run inspector in sandboxed environment
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit inspector permissions
4. **Security Testing**: Regular security assessment of tools

## Detection Methods

### Indicators of Compromise
- Unexpected process execution from inspector directory
- Network connections to suspicious external hosts
- Unusual system resource usage during inspection
- Modified system files or configurations

### Monitoring Recommendations
```bash
# Monitor inspector process activity
ps aux | grep mcp-inspector

# Check for unusual network connections
netstat -an | grep :8080

# Monitor file system changes
find /tmp -name "*.py" -mtime -1

# Check system logs for suspicious activity
grep "mcp-inspector" /var/log/syslog
```
